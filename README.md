# DataAnalyst_Internship-CognifyzTechnologys

This repository contains my data analysis project as part of my internship at **Cognifyz Technologies**. The project focuses on analyzing a dataset of restaurants, exploring various aspects such as cuisines, ratings, locations, price ranges, and online delivery options. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook using Python and various data analysis libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

## Project Overview

The analysis is structured into three levels, each consisting of multiple tasks designed to explore different dimensions of the restaurant data. The tasks range from basic exploratory analysis to advanced geographic and sentiment analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains detailed information about restaurants, including:
- Restaurant ID, Name, and Location
- Cuisines offered
- Price range and availability of services such as online delivery and table booking
- Customer ratings and reviews
- Number of votes received

## Project Structure

### Level 1 - Basic Exploratory Analysis

- **Task 1: Top Cuisines**
  - Identify the top three most common cuisines in the dataset.
  - Calculate the percentage of restaurants that serve each of the top cuisines.

- **Task 2: City Analysis**
  - Identify the city with the highest number of restaurants.
  - Calculate the average rating for restaurants in each city.
  - Determine the city with the highest average rating.

- **Task 3: Price Range Distribution**
  - Create a histogram or bar chart to visualize the distribution of price ranges.
  - Calculate the percentage of restaurants in each price range category.

- **Task 4: Online Delivery**
  - Determine the percentage of restaurants that offer online delivery.
  - Compare the average ratings of restaurants with and without online delivery.

### Level 2 - Intermediate Analysis

- **Task 1: Restaurant Ratings**
  - Analyze the distribution of aggregate ratings and determine the most common rating range.
  - Calculate the average number of votes received by restaurants.

- **Task 2: Cuisine Combination**
  - Identify the most common combinations of cuisines.
  - Determine if certain cuisine combinations tend to have higher ratings.

- **Task 3: Geographic Analysis**
  - Plot the locations of restaurants on a map using longitude and latitude coordinates.
  - Identify any patterns or clusters of restaurants in specific areas.

- **Task 4: Restaurant Chains**
  - Identify any restaurant chains in the dataset.
  - Analyze the ratings and popularity of different restaurant chains.

### Level 3 - Advanced Analysis

- **Task 1: Restaurant Reviews**
  - Analyze text reviews to identify the most common positive and negative keywords.
  - Calculate the average length of reviews and explore the relationship between review length and rating.

- **Task 2: Votes Analysis**
  - Identify the restaurants with the highest and lowest number of votes.
  - Analyze the correlation between the number of votes and the restaurant rating.

- **Task 3: Price Range vs. Online Delivery and Table Booking**
  - Analyze the relationship between price range and the availability of online delivery and table booking.
  - Determine if higher-priced restaurants are more likely to offer these services.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** for data processing and analysis.
- **Pandas** for data manipulation and handling.
- **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** for visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook** as the development environment.
